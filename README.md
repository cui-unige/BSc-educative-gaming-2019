```

To install on Ubuntu you have to upgrade your swift version to 4.2.1

For Ubuntu 16.04 follow the next steps

wget https://swift.org/builds/swift-4.2.1-release/ubuntu1604/swift-4.2.1-RELEASE/swift-4.2.1-RELEASE-ubuntu16.04.tar.gz

mkdir ~/swift

tar -xvzf swift-4.2.1-RELEASE-ubuntu16.04.tar.gz -C ~/swift

sudo nano ~/.bashrc

export PATH=~/swift/swift-4.2.1-RELEASE-ubuntu16.04/usr/bin:$PATH
```
Then verify the new version is correctly install
